**Objectives**
- Learn about ```align-items```
- Learn about the different values we can apply to justify-content
Flex can also be used to position smaller elements (like images or boxes) within a larger element. Properties like ```align-items``` and ```justify-content``` can be used to position the elements exactly where we want them within some larger element.
